# UI SDK

A library of UI behaviors for building accessible interfaces: keyboard navigation, focus, selection, dismissal, popups, drag and drop and the ARIA they need, in `@ui-sdk/core`, with adapters for React, Vue, Svelte, Solid and Web Components.

## Example

Every component in ui-sdk is built from behaviors. You start by creating the primitive with behaviors.

Don't worry you don't need to learn how to write this. Your agents will. And we made them really good at it.

```ts
import { createFocusRecovery, definePrimitive } from "@ui-sdk/core"

const searchField = definePrimitive({
  name: "search-field",
  state: () => ({ value: "" }),
  api: (context) => ({
    set: (value: string) => context.store.set({ value }),
    recovery: createFocusRecovery({ fallback: () => context.element("input") }),
  }),
  slots: (slot) => ({
    input: slot({
      attrs: (state) => ({ value: state.value }),
      on: {
        input: (event, { api }) =>
          api.set((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value),
      },
    }),
    clear: slot({
      present: (state) => state.value !== "",
      attrs: () => ({ type: "button" }),
      press: ({ api }) => api.set(""),
      bind: (el, part) => part.api.recovery.bind(el, part),
    }),
  }),
})

export { searchField }
```

Then render it in your framework with `createParts`. The parts are the same in all five.

### React

```tsx
import { createParts } from "@ui-sdk/react/primitive"
import { searchField } from "./search-field"

const parts = createParts(searchField, { input: "input", clear: "button" })

const SearchField = parts.Root
const SearchFieldInput = parts.Input
const SearchFieldClear = parts.Clear

function Search() {
  return (
    <SearchField>
      <SearchFieldInput placeholder="Search" />
      <SearchFieldClear>Clear</SearchFieldClear>
    </SearchField>
  )
}

export { Search }
```

### Vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { createParts } from "@ui-sdk/vue/primitive"
import { searchField } from "./search-field"

const parts = createParts(searchField, { input: "input", clear: "button" })

const SearchField = parts.Root
const SearchFieldInput = parts.Input
const SearchFieldClear = parts.Clear
</script>

<template>
  <SearchField>
    <SearchFieldInput placeholder="Search" />
    <SearchFieldClear>Clear</SearchFieldClear>
  </SearchField>
</template>
```

### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createParts } from "@ui-sdk/svelte/primitive"
  import { searchField } from "./search-field"

  const parts = createParts(searchField, { input: "input", clear: "button" })

  const SearchField = parts.Root
  const SearchFieldInput = parts.Input
  const SearchFieldClear = parts.Clear
</script>

<SearchField>
  <SearchFieldInput placeholder="Search" />
  <SearchFieldClear>Clear</SearchFieldClear>
</SearchField>
```

### Solid

```tsx
import { createParts } from "@ui-sdk/solid/primitive"
import { searchField } from "./search-field"

const parts = createParts(searchField, { input: "input", clear: "button" })

const SearchField = parts.Root
const SearchFieldInput = parts.Input
const SearchFieldClear = parts.Clear

function Search() {
  return (
    <SearchField>
      <SearchFieldInput placeholder="Search" />
      <SearchFieldClear>Clear</SearchFieldClear>
    </SearchField>
  )
}

export { Search }
```

### Web Components

Register a custom element for each part:

```ts
import { createParts, wrappedButton, wrappedChild } from "@ui-sdk/web"
import { searchField } from "./search-field"

createParts(searchField, {
  root: "search-field",
  input: { tag: "search-field-input", target: wrappedChild("input") },
  clear: { tag: "search-field-clear", target: wrappedButton },
})
```

Then use them in your HTML:

```html
<search-field>
  <search-field-input><input placeholder="Search" /></search-field-input>
  <search-field-clear><button>Clear</button></search-field-clear>
</search-field>
```
