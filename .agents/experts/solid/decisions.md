# Solid expert: decisions

What's already decided about `@ui-sdk/solid`, and what's known and open. The expert never re-raises a **Settled** item as a finding.

## Settled

- **Solid 2 only** (`solid-js >=2.0.0-rc.14`). `ownedWrite` workarounds for signals written while children render go when Solid 2 is final. Signals fed by core's listeners keep it for good, since core writes synchronously during a disposal whatever Solid does.
- **`render` is the only way to render your own element.** No `as`, no `<Dynamic>` prop.
- **Solid's dev diagnostics are a gate**: `packages/solid/test/diagnostics.test.tsx` and the playground's checker fail on any code but the allowed ones.
- **Form component dropped.**
- **Parts read controlled options from the props** (`instance.follow`), not one flush after an effect hands them over. On main as `b38603a`.
- **A part's read tracks what core's callbacks read** (`readPart` returns `read()`), so a `getHref` or `itemToLabel` that reads a signal or an async memo renders its parts again. Core reads the props' delivery untracked itself (`untrack(current)`). Render counts are otherwise unchanged (PR 53).
- **CSP nonce**: a page sets it with `<meta property="csp-nonce" nonce="…">`. A tag with no nonce switches injected styles to constructed sheets, and the page declares `@layer ui-sdk;` first. (Chosen for PR 17, 2026-10-28.)
- **Popups flip to the opposite side only**, never to a perpendicular one.
- **`tests/specs/position.spec.ts` runs once per engine**, on `react` in Chromium and `web` elsewhere: the placement math is core's and doesn't depend on the framework.
- **A package `Checkbox` or `Toggle` joins only a package `CheckboxGroup` or `ToggleGroup`**, through the group's own context. A group root built with `createParts` or `usePart` doesn't reach it. This matches Svelte and keeps the group out of a standalone control's bundle.
- **A half-typed date reads `null`.** Writing `null` back leaves its segments, so a controlled value can't empty them; `clear()` does. Same in every framework.

- **`web.css` lets parts inherit the page's font.** `--ui-font-sans` is a token a page opts into on `body`; parts never set `font-family` themselves, except `code` and `kbd`, which use `--ui-font-mono`.
- **`web.css` colors follow the page's `color-scheme` through `light-dark()`.** Builds that rewrite `light-dark()` (Lightning CSS in Next and Vite) read the `--lightningcss-light`/`--lightningcss-dark` defaults `web.css` sets, so they fall back to light unless the build also processes a `color-scheme`.
- **Button-like parts render `type`, `disabled` and `aria-disabled` together until they bind**, and no role, so server HTML is right for a `<button>` and an `<a>`. On an `<a>` or `<span>`, `type` and `disabled` are invalid but inert until then, and a disabled link still navigates before hydration, since only script can stop the click. Before bind they don't write `tabindex`, so a web component's author tabindex survives the first pass (PR 326, 2026-11-09).

## Known and open (don't report again, check whether fixed)

- **A drawer or popover open in server HTML is unpositioned until hydration.** `web.css` now places the drawer's viewport; an open popover still sits in flow until core positions it (suspected, PR 321).
- **`data-required` reaches field parts around a required Combobox only after mount** (suspected, PR 321).

- **Parts hear every change** (`WASTED_RECOMPUTE`): the fix records which state keys a part reads.
- **No `solid-ssr` hydration fixture with author ids.**
- **Payload types**: a popup content's payload type is asserted by the user, not tied to the controller's type.
- **A Checkbox in its own Field inside a CheckboxGroup** is unnamed in server markup until hydration.
- **Callbacks behind core's caches**, like a combobox `filter` (cached by identity in `listbox-engine.ts`) or what `sync` derives, are tracked only by the first part that reads them and stay stale while their identity holds. Suspected, not reproduced.
- **Solid's event delegation keeps an event's target alive** (`@solidjs/web` rc.14 to rc.19): its handler defines a `currentTarget` getter on each delegated event, a new closure each time. V8 keeps the first of those getters on the shape that all events of that type share, so one keydown, click or focus event, its target and the page around it stay alive for the life of the page. Any app with a delegated handler gets it, whatever ui-sdk does. rc.19 deletes the getter after dispatch, but that leaves each event in dictionary mode and doesn't free the getter on the shape: on rc.19 a focus event still keeps a slider's input alive, and the combobox, slider and resizable leak tests that pass on rc.14 fail. One shared getter (a module-level descriptor that reads the current node from the event) fixes it: all 36 Solid leak tests pass with it, on rc.19. Don't move to rc.19 for this. Don't work around it in the adapter: Solid's root listener defines the getter on every delegated event, whoever registered the handler. Until Solid ships a fix, the repo patches `@solidjs/web` with that shared getter (`patches/@solidjs__web@2.0.0-rc.14.patch`), so the Solid leak tests, the single unmount test included, check our own code. The patch reaches only this repo: apps using `@ui-sdk/solid` still have the leak. Moving to another rc means redoing the patch for it.
- **`useAsyncOptions` called inside an `onSettled` callback** throws `CLEANUP_IN_FORBIDDEN_SCOPE` from its `onCleanup` calls (same on main before PR 14).
- **A popup stays shown when its anchor is clipped by a scroll container.** A marker like `data-anchor-hidden` is a public API and waits on discussion.
- **An anchor moved by the Web Animations API** is followed by positioning's 500ms slow check, not on the next frame.
- **Tabs with panels before the list** (a bottom tab bar) render the first tab selected and no panel on the server. A panel renders before its tab has props, so it can't tell it's the one shown. It appears once the tabs bind.
- **An author id on a control in a Field** (`NumberInputControl id`, `PasswordInputControl id`) isn't in the server HTML's label `for`, nor in a step button rendered before it: they can't read an id that renders after them. Putting the `id` on the `Field` works. It's right once the field binds.
- **A submit shortcut also submits a read-only Textarea.**
- **Holding Enter submits on every key repeat** with a submit shortcut: it doesn't skip `event.repeat`.
- **`submitShortcut="enter"` leaves phones no way to add a line**: a soft keyboard has no Shift+Enter, and the textarea sets no `enterkeyhint`.

## Revisit

- `packages/solid/src/index.ts` lists `./label`, `./segmented-control`, `./color-picker` and `./image-cropper` out of alphabetical order.
