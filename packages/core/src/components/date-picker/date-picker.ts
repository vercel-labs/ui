// A date picker: a text input that reads a date typed in the page's language,
// and a button that opens a calendar in a popup. The grid is Calendar's, with
// its keys and range picking, and the popup is the one Popover uses. Values
// are ISO strings, as in Calendar. This module is the public API and assembles
// the primitive. State and the API live in date-picker-api.ts, and parts and
// attributes in date-picker-parts.ts.
