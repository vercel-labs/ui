// Autocomplete: a text field that suggests as you type. The text is the
// value, free as any input's, and choosing a suggestion only fills it in. It
// can complete inline, with the rest of the first match selected after the
// caret, and it takes part in forms as the text field it is. It's built on
// the listbox engine Combobox uses. This module is the public API and
// assembles the primitive; state and the API live in autocomplete-api.ts,
// and parts and attributes in autocomplete-parts.ts.
