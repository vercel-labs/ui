Components that left the page, like a closed tab\'s fields, follow with offPage: true and the state they had. A long page ends with an entry whose component is "more", saying how many were left out: use query to find them. confirm says a person must make that component\'s change.

      'Runs one or more actions in order, in one call: put every step you already know in the same call, even ones on another tab or in a menu or dialog an earlier step opens. A step names a component by ref, or by its label, row text or kind, like "Jane Doe" or "slider". action is one of its actions, like setValue, setChecked or setOpen, or "press" with a button\'s text, which opens a closed menu or dialog first, so there\'s no need to open it or see its buttons. setValue, open and the like take a value or an item\'s or section\'s label, like "Germany" or "Email". Name components and buttons by the words in your task, like "Remove": a step that names nothing fails and lists what is there, so a guess costs no more than looking first. Stops at the first step that fails and says why. A step that fails with "Needs a person" is one the person must do or approve: tell them what it does and let them do it, instead of looking for another way. A component in a closed accordion section is found too, and its section opens. Returns what each step pressed, changed or removed, what came onto the page, and every field\'s value, so there\'s no need to call snapshot to check; a long page\'s values keep the fields the steps touched or changed and end with more. Most tasks take one act for every change, then one to save once the values are right. Example, a field, a tab, a row\'s menu and its confirm dialog: { "steps": [{ "ref": "Display name", "action": "setValue", "args": ["Acme"] }, { "ref": "Settings", "action": "setValue", "args": ["Billing"] }, { "ref": "Jane Doe", "action": "press", "args": ["Delete"] }, { "ref": "dialog", "action": "press", "args": ["Delete"] }] }.',
