// What can move a positioned popup or its anchor once both sit still:
// scrolling, resizing, the page changing, input, things loading, and
// animations starting. Positioning sleeps while none of these happen, so an
// open popup on a page nobody touches does next to no work, and wakes on the
// first of them. Once awake, it stays awake for as long as something moves,
// like an anchor in a sliding sidebar. What nothing here reports, like an
// animation that holds still and then moves again, is the slow check's job.
//
// A popup sits outside the page's flow, so nothing that happens inside it can
// move it or its anchor. It can only change the popup's size, which the
// popup's own ResizeObserver reports. So a change inside a popup wakes the
// others, like a submenu anchored to the item that changed, and not the popup
// itself: moving the highlight through a menu runs no positioning frames.
