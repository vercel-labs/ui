// record of that work as it makes it, and the framework keeps the instance
// while it holds it: `keep()` starts the work and `release()` stops it, while
// the instance keeps its state, like React's <Activity> hiding it. Most
// frameworks keep an instance from the moment they make it, so it's kept at
// once, though only in a browser: a server never destroys what it renders, so
// a module-level controller would hold a request's instance. React makes
// instances in renders it may throw away, like StrictMode's second state
// initializer, so it makes them inside `unwatched` and keeps one once it
// commits. An instance made while another is being made has a record of its
// own, which the outer one keeps and releases with its own work. `destroy()`
// discards the record, then runs the instance's `onDestroy` callbacks, once.
