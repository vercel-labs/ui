// The state a primitive keeps, and who hears when it changes.
//
// - Held state is what `set` wrote, the store's own, which `heldState` reads.
// - Followed state is what a framework renders before it hands it over, as
//   Solid and Svelte do: after `follow(read)`, `get()` reads the keys `read`
//   returns ahead of held state, and the next write that isn't `delivered`
//   lands them first, as delivered, so it builds on what the page shows.
// - Viewed state is what `get()` returns inside `view(state, read)`, like a
//   render's preview. Nothing ever writes it.
// - `renders` counts the changes that can change what renders, all but those
//   to live keys alone, and `writes` the changes other than what `follow`
//   delivered, so a renderer tells whether to look again.
// - `delivered` marks a change to keys `follow` already handed over, which
//   parts that read them through their framework skip.
// - Every change reaches the component's own listeners, from `subscribe`,
//   before any part: parts hear through `subscribeSkipping`, and the ones
//   that select single values through the fanout `kernel/selects.ts`
//   installs, both after. So what a component listener changes in turn, like
//   a tab panel starting to exit, is in place before parts look, however late
//   it subscribed.
