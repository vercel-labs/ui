/**
 * Defines a component's behavior without its markup: its state, an api that
 * changes it, and its parts, called slots. Every adapter renders the result
 * with `createParts`, which reads `options` and each slot's `props` to tell
 * them from an element's own. Each slot's element gets `data-slot="<name>-<slot>"`.
 *
 * @example
 * export const disclosure = definePrimitive({
 *   name: "disclosure",
 *   options: { open: "boolean", defaultOpen: "boolean", onOpenChange: "callback" },
 *   state: (options: { open?: boolean; defaultOpen?: boolean; onOpenChange?: (open: boolean, details: ChangeDetails<"trigger-press">) => void }) => ({
 *     open: options.open ?? options.defaultOpen ?? false,
 *   }),
 *   sync: (options) => (options.open === undefined ? {} : { open: options.open }),
 *   api: (context) => {
 *     const change = createChange(context)
 *     return { toggle: (event?: Event) => change("open", !context.store.get().open, { reason: "trigger-press", event }) }
 *   },
 *   slots: (slot) => ({
 *     trigger: slot({
 *       attrs: (state) => ({ type: "button", "aria-expanded": String(state.open) }),
 *       press: ({ api }, event) => api.toggle(event),
